# JavaScript Password Generator
## Description
Using promts to have the user decide how many characters their password needs to be, but make the minimum characker length be 8 and the maximum be 128 characters.
An if statement is used to check to see if the length specified is between 8 and 128 and to verify its a number.
A new prompt asking if the user would like to use lower case, upper case, numbers, and or special characters to use in the password.
After all five prompts have been answered an array containing only those characters specified will be created.
The password will then be generated by looping through the created array the number of times specified by the user and displayed on the screen in the "Generate a Password box".
